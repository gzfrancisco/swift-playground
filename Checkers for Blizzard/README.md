# Checkers for Blizzard Code Test

The game do:

* Display the board
* Place the pieces in the right position
* Capture the input from the pieces and available spaces
* The user can make movements
* Perform 3 first movements from the opponent.
* The user can eat AI pieces

The game is prepare to:

* Create some UI components in the GameController because its decoupled from the BoardController, I would like to add some notifications or labels for the status.
* The Opponent class can know the empty spaces and their pieces, so its easy know if some piece from the user can be eaten because the controller have the method canEat: with the correct rules for User or for AI.

Iâ€™m sorry but I only invest like 4:30 hours. If I can have more time I would like to finish.

Thanks for everything!
